# Silent Failure of WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync on Android in Expo

This repository demonstrates a bug where `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync` in Expo fails silently on some Android devices. The promise resolves, but the browser doesn't actually open.

## Bug Description

The `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync` function from Expo's `expo-web-browser` package is used to open a URL in the device's default browser. On certain Android devices, particularly older ones, this function can resolve its promise without throwing an error, even though the browser fails to launch.  This makes debugging difficult because there's no clear indication of failure.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app on an affected Android device.
3. Tap the button to open the browser.
4. Observe that the browser does not open, but the console log shows a successful result.

## Solution

The provided solution attempts to handle the issue by adding more robust error handling and checking the result object's `type` field for potential errors. While not perfect, this approach provides better feedback in cases where the browser fails to open, assisting with debugging and providing clearer information to the user.
